To discover a Region, simply discover all the locations within it. It will then be marked as discovered by you, $name, and you will become more famous. Discovered regions are visible to your _Rivals_, and marked on everyone's _World Map_."
"io-hub-ask-outposts-txt","The Servant explained: _Outposts_ are pockets of civilization in this strange land, established by the _Explorer Clubs_. This and every other Outpost lies on a swift _river_, all connected together. To find other Outposts, just follow the rivers - or use your compass, which will point to the closest undiscovered Outpost. If you, $name, are the first to find an Outpost, it shall be named in your honour! But: your _Rivals_ can follow in your footsteps and begin their future Expeditions from there with ease."

"io-hub-ask-provinces-txt","The Servant explained: Regions are grouped together into _Provinces_, according their resistance to exploration. This Outpost lies in the province called $segmentname. You will know that you have entered a new Province as its name and difficulty rating will be apparent. Note that not all Provinces contain an Outpost."
"io-hub-ask-badges-txt","The Servant explained: some Crates contain _Badges_. These can be used to equip a new Trek in such a manner as to create new opportunities, with which your humble _Badge Servant_ will be excruciatingly happy to assist."
"io-hub-ask-fame-txt","The Servant explained: you can become more _famous_ as you explore, by discovering Regions and Outposts. But in order to become famous from _treasure_, you must deliver any items you have to an Outpost. The people here will be most impressed. If you want, you can _salvage_ many treasures you find, and break them down into jewels. The people will be a bit less impressed then. But still somewhat impressed. When the world ends, the most famous _Rivals_ will be rewarded with an extra Medal."
