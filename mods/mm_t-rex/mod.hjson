    #We are adding a new enemy to the game. The game can tell we want to make an enemy because of the emy- prefix
    #Since we don't want to modify anything already in the game, there is no target it

    #We give the new enemy the trex-large.png sprite that we defined above
    #It has 20 HP and 4 attack dice. Those dice do not exist yet, so we will have to add them later as well
    #It also drops the item it-trexTooth, which we will also have to add
