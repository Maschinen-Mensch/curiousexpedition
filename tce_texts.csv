"tu-combatAttack","This one can trigger an attack on its own. You can trigger any combo of dice as long as you have rolled the fitting dice faces. Lets trigger the attack!"
"tu-combatAttackEnemy","It is the enemies' turn now. They are attacking you!"
"tu-combatBlock","You selected two dice that form a valid combo. Every combo has a different effect. A MIND and SHIELD face allows you to trigger the combo TACTICAL ADVANTAGE, which allows you build up your defence. Trigger the combo by clicking the big button."
"tu-combatDone","Close one! The enemy will now be passive for some turns. Keep heading towards that question mark."
"tu-combatEndRound","As you saw you can trigger multiple combos per round, but right now you don't have any dice left. It is time for the enemies to react. Click the End Round button."
"tu-combatFlee","As long as you have not rolled any dice you may also try to flee. These enemies are a bit too strong for us. Click the Flee button."
"tu-combatPinFirst","You rolled STABILITY and MIND faces. That's no valid combo. Keep the MIND face by clicking on it."
"tu-combatPinSecond","You found a valid combination. Possible combos are indicated by vibrating dice. Click the SHIELD to select the die."
"tu-combatPinThird","You also rolled a SWORD face on the red die. Select it now."
"tu-combatReroll","You can reroll all dice that you did not keep. Click the ROLL button."
"tu-combatRoll","You are being attacked! The combat system works by rolling dice and combining them into attacks. Start by clicking the ROLL button."
"tu-compass","Thankfully the tiger is gone. The compass in the upper left corner will point in the direction of the Golden Pyramid. However, initially its accuracy is very bad. Explore some more to improve it. There is another question mark. Go find out what it is."
"tu-itemUsage","You can restore your sanity through various means such as resting at certain places or using items. Left-click the chocolate rations at the bottom of your screen to consume them now."
"tu-movement","Move the mouse over fields to see a travel preview. Left-click to set a waypoint. Click on your last waypoint to start moving, or use the “Travel” button in the lower centre of your screen. Right-click removes waypoints. Move inland now."
"tu-noSanity","Your sanity is quite low. You can move with 0 sanity, however doing so will cause bad events to happen and ultimately will cause the failure of your expedition. Move some more with zero sanity."
"tu-oldCamp","It's an old campsite! Once you are on or in the field next to a location you can visit it. Move closer and interact with it by clicking the “Explore” button at the lower centre of your screen."
"tu-oldCampSearch","Search the old campsite and take all loot."
"tu-overburden-1","You are overburdened. How much you can carry depends on the capacity of your units. You can still move, but your sanity loss is greatly increased when travelling. Right-click the torch."
"tu-overburden-2","You won’t need that torch, trust me. Click the crate symbol right of the inventory to drop the torch."
"tu-overburden-3","Now that you are no longer overburdened it is time to head towards the question mark. Feel free to consume some of your supplies to regain sanity before moving."
"tu-promote-1","Very good, you have found all locations within this region. This grants you a region point, which can be used to increase the rank of one of your units. Now click on a unit with a green + to promote it."

"tu-recruitingSelect","You can inspect the attributes of each character by hovering over their name or image. Choose your new trek member."
"tu-sanity","Every time you move you will lose some sanity. Each move has a base sanity cost, so try to move in longer distances to be effective. Continue travelling inland."
"tu-ship-1","You have successfully made it to the ship, very good. Your crew and equipment has been waiting for you here."
"tu-ship-2","Now it is time to find what you actually came here for: the Golden Pyramid! It is hidden somewhere on this map and is the goal of each expedition. "
"tu-shipSpawn","The villagers have told you about a giant wooden fish - maybe that is where your ship is located. Head towards the new question mark."
"tu-shrine-1","Shrines are sacred places of the tribes living in each expedition area. Here you are able to find valuable artefacts, but taking them will drastically reduce your standing towards the natives."
"tu-shrine-2","You don’t have to loot shrines and steal holy artefacts to play this game. However, for the sake of demonstration, do it now."
"tu-shrine-3","Whoops, this may have been bad advice. Besides negative consequences towards the natives, looting shrines will also trigger ancient curses, like this volcano outbreak."
"tu-standing","You can see your local standing right of your sanity bar now. Your standing will change depending on your actions. If your standing is too low, you will not be able to recruit natives or rest in their village. Let’s trade with the villagers to increase your standing."
"tu-tradingBasic","You can see what they have to offer in the top bar. For now, you only want to increase your standing with the villagers though. \n \n Offer them all the marbles in your inventory by right-clicking them."
"tu-tradingStanding","You are offering more than you are asking for. The DEAL button has become green and shows you that accepting the trade now will increase your standing. Click the green button to accept the deal."
"tu-villageLeave","It's time to leave the village and continue looking for our ship."
"tu-villageReach","Native Villages are one of the most important locations to visit on each expedition. Move to the village and enter it."
"tu-villageRest","Here you can rest, trade or recruit villagers to join your trek. You should rest now."
